    GeForce is a brand of graphics processing units (GPUs) designed by Nvidia.
    As of the GeForce 30 series, there have been seventeen iterations of the
    design. The first GeForce products were discrete GPUs designed for add-on
    graphics boards, intended for the high-margin PC gaming market, and later
    diversification of the product line covered all tiers of the PC graphics
    market, ranging from cost-sensitive[1] GPUs integrated on motherboards, to
    mainstream add-in retail boards. Most recently, GeForce technology has been
    introduced into Nvidia's line of embedded application processors, designed
    for electronic handhelds and mobile handsets. With respect to discrete GPUs,
    found in add-in graphics-boards, Nvidia's GeForce and AMD's Radeon GPUs are
    the only remaining competitors in the high-end market. GeForce GPUs are very
    dominant in the general-purpose graphics processor unit (GPGPU) market
    thanks to their proprietary CUDA architecture.[2] GPGPU is expected to
    expand GPU functionality beyond the traditional rasterization of 3D
    graphics, to turn it into a high-performance computing device able to
    execute arbitrary programming code in the same way a CPU does, but with
    different strengths (highly parallel execution of straightforward
    calculations) and weaknesses (worse
