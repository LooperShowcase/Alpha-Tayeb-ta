          is an American multinational technology company incorporated in
          Delaware and based in Santa Clara, California. It designs graphics
          processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as
          well as system on a chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and
          automotive market. Its primary GPU line, labeled "GeForce", is in
          direct competition with the GPUs of the "Radeon" brand by Advanced
          Micro Devices (AMD). Nvidia expanded its presence in the gaming
          industry with its handheld game consoles Shield Portable, Shield
          Tablet, and Shield Android TV and its cloud gaming service GeForce
          Now. Its professional line of GPUs are used in workstations for
          applications in such fields as architecture, engineering and
          construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific
          research, and manufacturing design.[3] In addition to GPU
          manufacturing, Nvidia provides an application programming interface
          (API) called CUDA that allows the creation of massively parallel
          programs which utilize GPUs. They are deployed in supercomputing sites
          around the world.[6][7] More recently, it has moved into the mobile
          computing market, where it produces Tegra mobile processors for
          smartphones and tablets as well as vehicle navigation and
          entertainment systems. In addition to AMD, its competitors include
          Intel and Qualcomm. Nvidia announced plans on September 13, 2020 to
          acquire Arm Ltd. from SoftBank, pending regulatory approval, for a
          value of US$40 billion in stock and cash, which would be the largest
          semiconductor acquisition to date. SoftBank Group will acquire
          slightly less than a 10% stake in Nvidia, and Arm will maintain its
          headquarters in Cambridge. Nvidia Corporation is an American
          multinational technology company incorporated in Delaware and based in
