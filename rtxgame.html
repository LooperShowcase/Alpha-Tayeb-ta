    Manufacturing and Product Design Design, engineer, simulate, and render your
    next amazing product at home, in the office, from the factory, or wherever
    you need to work. Leverage the power of real-time ray tracing, AI, and
    advanced graphics in a thin and light form factor to create advanced design
    visualizations on the go. Simulate structural, fluid, and electromagnetic
    product performance to get an accurate understanding of design functionality
    quickly—anytime, anywhere. Media and Entertainment Model, animate, simulate,
    and render photorealistic characters, environments, and visual effects in
    the studio, on location, or from anywhere. Edit up to 8K quality footage
    with AI-enhanced features. Bring RTX acceleration to the creative
    applications you use every day to create, animate, and design more visually
    stunning content than ever before. Architecture, Engineering, and
    Construction Design, review, modify, and accurately visualize complex 3D
    building models anywhere, from your office to your customer locations.
    Immerse yourself in large-scale building designs with virtual reality.
    Create compelling photorealistic renderings with lifelike reflections,
    shadows, and lighting with ray-tracing acceleration. AI and Data Science
    Accomplish compute-intensive data science tasks from anywhere. Explore large
    datasets and features and train and validate models directly on your laptop.
    Examine large datasets with high levels of interactivity, without cutting
    down the size of the data or reducing fidelity. Save environment setup time
    with NGC-Ready™ data science mobile workstations, which include the most
    widely used AI frameworks and SDKs, like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
